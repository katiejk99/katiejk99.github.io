                Hi! My name is Katie and I'm currently a senior at University of California, Berkeley. 
                I'm currently pursuing a double major in Compuer Science, and Molecular and Cell Biology with emphasis on Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Track 1).
                I often introduce myself as a Korean from Canada studying in the US, but with my graduation rolling around the corner in Spring 2021, I'm sad to say that I no longer will have that phrase to introduce myself. 

            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of my CS background, I really enjoy web development as my current and previous internships have been creating web apps from scratch for the companies I worked for. 
                I've also had the opportunity to dabble a little bit in computer graphics through coursework: CS184. 
                Combined, I've been able to make cool graphics projects that you can see in my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page as well as making this website alone was a fun side project I did during Fall 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I'm interested in projects that lie at the intersection of biology and technology, and I'm excited that I'm working as a software developer currently for a biotech startup at Berkeley SkyDeck 
                that has cryopreservation technology for Fall 2020. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working on projects for school, clubs, work, or personal fun, you can catch me outside playing golf, or watching YouTube videos on movie recaps. 
                I also play the cello and love playing in ensembles&mdash;small and large! 
            </p>
