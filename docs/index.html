          Hi! My name is Katie and I'm a Berkeley alum. I'm graduated with a
          double major in Compuer Science, and Molecular and Cell Biology with
          emphasis on Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Track 1). I often
          introduce myself as a Korean from Canada studying in the US, but since
          leaving Berkeley in August 2021, I've also graduated from that phrase.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working as a Software Development Engineer at Expedia Group
          since September 2021. I completed my rotational new grad program last
          fall where I got to work with 2 (very) different teams for half a year
          each. First, I was on a B2B team that suggested different types of
          business opportunities for property managers on Expedia Partner
          Central (surprise! who knew this portal existed?). Then, I was on the
          front-end focused team for the virtual agent that exists throughout
          Expedia products. (Specifically I worked a lot with accessibility
          features).
        </p>
        <p>
          I've come to really enjoy (full stack) web development, as most of my
          previous internship projects were creating complete web applications
          from scratch for the companies I worked for. I've also had the
          opportunity to dabble a little bit in computer graphics through
          coursework in Summer 2020&mdash;CS184: Foundations of Computer
          Graphics. Through all these different experiences, I've been able to
          make cool graphics and web development projects that you can see in my
          <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, and making this website
          itself was a fun side project I did in Fall 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also interested in projects that lie at the intersection of
          biology and technology, and I had the opportunity to do just
          that&mdash;as a software developer during my senior year in Berkeley
          for <a href="http://www.fibulas.com/index.htm">Fibulas, Inc.</a>, a
          biotech startup focussing on cryopreservation technology, at Berkeley
          SkyDeck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, you can catch me outside playing golf, listening to
          the same songs over and over on Spotify (check out my current
          favourite playlist "wish i was in los angeles" on the top right
          corner!), or watching YouTube videos on movie recaps. I also play the
          cello and love playing in ensembles&mdash;small and large. I'll be
          joining the South Bay Philharmonic for their upcoming concert season
          starting in the 2023 Fall!
