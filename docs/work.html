          <h3>Expedia Group</h3>
          <p>Software Development Engineer II | Present | Seattle, WA</p>

        <p>
          I have been a Software Developer Engineer at Expedia Group since
          September 2021. During my first year, I was on the new grad rotational
          program and I got to work for 6 months each on 2 different teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I worked with Virtual Market Coach, which was a tool that
          Expedia Lodging Partners (e.g. hotel managers, other devs, etc.) used
          to gain insight and tips on how to increase their business through
          different kind of promotions and deals they could activate for their
          logdging listing. Here, I created end-to-end a tool that internal
          users (e.g. Expedia Group devs) to easily look up a list of properties
          that had a specific promotion type.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I was on the front-end team for the Virtual Agent Control. I
          specialized in accessibility engineering and made sure that both web
          and mobile versions of the virtual agent was not only compliant with
          legal accessibilty standards but also seamlessly useable by any user.
          I also helped decrease cloud costs for the team by significantly
          decreasing (by 10 fold!) file sizes of reference images that we were
          storing to run browser compatibility checks against by adding a
          cropping function in the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I'm working on the Identity team as an SDE II, and we've had
          a really big project that just launched called One Identity. This
          feature integrates the login for all Expedia affiliated brands
          (Expedia.com, Vrbo.com, and Hotels.com) into one profile, and one
          credential set. I was specifically helping with onboarding Vrbo
          authentication systems to the One Identity platform. I also worked on
          automating our team's CICD to take advantage of the serverless aspect
          of Github Actions.

        <p>
          Working closely with a client based at the University of Pittsburgh
          School of Medicine, I created a Django web application from scratch
          that was a database interface for Fibulas, Inc.'s BioUSB
          cryopreservation technology. Users were able to organize, and keep
          track of check in/out data of samples that were in BioUSBs.

        <p>
          I worked with 5 other software engineering interns to create a Django
          web application from scratch to help college students match with peers
          of similar interests using a hierarchical clustering machine learning
          algorithm. Users were sent weekly notifications of their time for
          meeting, creating a group chat with Agora video conferencing API
          integrated so that they can meet virtually during the COVID19
          pandemic.
